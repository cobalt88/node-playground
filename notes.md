# General notes and things

## Useful commands to remember:

**ctrl + c** 
(for windows/GitBash users) This is how you exit an app that is running in the terminal. Just in case the app does not programmatically exit on its own or you did something to accidentally make a program that never stops running. Ran into this issue the first time i called app.js

**npm install -g nodemon**
This will install the nodemon (node monitor) package globally.
Having this installed will allow you to run **nodemon** app.js instead of just **node** app.js
What nodemon does: 

* nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. Very similar to the live server extension in VS Code.
